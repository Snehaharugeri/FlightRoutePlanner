# FlightRoutePlanner
This mini-project is a flight route planner developed in C, designed to aid travelers in efficiently planning their flights by identifying the shortest route between cities. At its core, the project employs Dijkstra's algorithm to navigate a graph representing flight connections among various cities. The user interacts with the program through a straightforward menu interface, allowing them to choose between displaying available flights, finding the shortest route between two cities, or exiting the application. This interface enhances usability and ensures a seamless experience for users. The project also incorporates dynamic memory allocation to accommodate varying numbers of cities and flights, along with robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage invalid inputs or runtime errors. With its focus on simplicity, functionality, and user-friendliness, this flight route planner serves as a practical tool for travelers seeking efficient flight itinerary planning.
